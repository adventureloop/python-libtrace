# python-libtrace

A Cpython module to make the 
[libtrace library](http://research.wand.net.nz/software/libtrace.php) 
available to Python2 and/or python3

python-libtrace is not a complete set of all the libtrace routines,
rather it's a somewhat simplified set, intended as an easy-to-use
toolkit, and one that should be suitable for networking students.  It use (more or less) the original field names
within the various header decodes.

For installation and usage instructions see: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)
